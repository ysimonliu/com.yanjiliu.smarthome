Through Eclipse, you can export the same project to 4 instances with different launch configuration into different names.

They exported names have to be:
EMM.jar
Sensor.jar
HomeManager.jar
SmartHomeUI.jar

For the testing data files, the names of these files have to be kept the same. But you can edit the data inside all you want.

All these limitations are due to the simple batch files that I wrote.

After all is done, simply run runtest.bat, and everything will be straightforward from there.
